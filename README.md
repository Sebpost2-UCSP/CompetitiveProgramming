# Sem06-CompetitiveProgramming

### Course Overview
This repository contains assignments and weekly problem-solving exercises from the **Competitive Programming** course taken in my sixth semester. The course focused on mastering algorithmic techniques, problem identification, and efficient coding for competitive programming environments. Throughout the semester, we practiced on Codeforces, solving a minimum of two problems each week rated **C difficulty or higher**.

### Learning Outcomes
Key skills developed in this course include:
- Rapid problem identification and matching algorithms or data structures to solve them efficiently.
- Implementing a variety of algorithms and techniques, particularly for complex problem scenarios.
- Improving code efficiency and speed, which are critical in competitive programming.

### Repository Structure

#### 1. Algoritmos
This directory contains a collection of algorithmic implementations studied during the course. Each sub-directory includes `.cpp` files demonstrating the core principles and applications of the respective algorithms.

   - **BinaryTreeLCA**: Implemented the **Lowest Common Ancestor** algorithm for binary trees, allowing efficient queries for ancestral relationships between nodes.
   - **Djikstra**: Implemented **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for shortest path finding in weighted graphs.
   - **Edmonds Karp**: Applied the **Edmonds-Karp** algorithm for calculating the maximum flow in a flow network, a key algorithm for graph-based problems.
   - **Kosaraju**: Implemented **Kosaraju’s Algorithm** for finding strongly connected components in a directed graph.
   - **Quick Hull**: Developed the **Quick Hull** algorithm, an efficient method for computing the convex hull of a set of points in 2D space.
   - **Shift_or**: Demonstrated the **Shift-Or Algorithm**, often used for fast string matching and searching within text.
   - **Sweep_Line**: Implemented the **Sweep Line Algorithm**, useful for geometric problems and interval management.
   - **Tree Print**: Developed functions to print a binary tree from various perspectives, including vertical, left-aligned, right-aligned, and inverted views.

#### 2. Problemas de competitiva
This directory contains all competitive programming problems solved on Codeforces, organized by weekly folders (`semana 1` through `semana 12`). Each folder includes at least two `.cpp` files representing the solutions to problems tackled during that week, focusing on challenges rated C or higher.

   - **Weekly Structure**: Each week, I focused on applying different algorithms and techniques from the course to solve Codeforces problems, refining my skills in:
     - Problem identification and analysis
     - Applying efficient data structures and algorithms
     - Enhancing speed and accuracy under competitive conditions

### Usage Instructions
Each `.cpp` file in both `Algoritmos` and `Problemas de competitiva` directories can be compiled and run individually:
1. **Navigate** to the desired directory (e.g., `Algoritmos/BinaryTreeLCA` or `Problemas de competitiva/semana 1`).
2. **Compile** with a C++ compiler, such as `g++`:
   ```bash
   g++ -o output_file_name file_name.cpp
   ```
3. **Execute** the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output_file_name
   ```
